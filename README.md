The objective of this analysis is to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to identify key factors contributing to loan defaults within the banking and financial services industry. By examining a dataset that includes borrower demographics, financial history, and loan details, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that can enhance risk assessment and decision-making processes. The ultimate goal is to generate actionable insights that financial institutions can use to optimize their lending strategies, reduce the risk of defaults, and improve overall profitability.
